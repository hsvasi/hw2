The project is a fictional soccer store. There are pages that show different apparel, balls and boots
that are sold by the store. The prices are listed in a table format. Each page links back to the home page.
The home page does not use "flex" blocks, so the view on mobile pages is not scaled. However, all other pages do use flex blocks so they display appropriately on mobile pages.

The Netlify website for the website is as follows:
